# Text-Buffer
A C++ buffer for text parsing.

### TextBuffer's Suggested Font

The TextBuffer project takes advantage of fonts with ligature support, as a consequence; comments in the TextBuffer project are well organized, are easy to read, and can say more while using less characters than a regular font. Unfortunately this can occasionally result in comments being less readable for readers using a regular font. The TextBuffer suggested font is Fira Code, however, both of the fonts 'Cascadia Code' and 'JetBrains Mono' work perfectly fine too.
